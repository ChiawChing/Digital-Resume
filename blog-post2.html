      <h2>üíª My Learning Experience with HTML & CSS</h2>
      <p><em>Published on May 28, 2025</em></p>
      <p>
        Building this website from scratch taught me the true power of HTML structure and CSS styling. I started with simple tags and styles,
        and gradually learned how to structure content semantically and design responsive layouts that look good on any device.
      </p>
      <p>
        From headers and footers to forms and buttons, every line of code helped me understand how front-end design works.
        I also gained experience using external fonts, media queries, and card layouts to enhance usability and aesthetic appeal.
